# Dissolved-Oxygen-vs-Depth-of-ocean-Water
For this project I wanted to determine if there is a relationship between the depth of the ocean and the amount of disolved oxygen in the water.  To accomplish this task properly I needed to first find usable data to process and compare.  I Found data that I could use on the NOAA website.  This data is from a cruise completed in 2018 and the data was otained on March 5 of that year.  To obtain the same data you can access it from the link below.  
https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0080/0132082/3.3/data/0-data/
In this link there are 2 files that contain useful data.  I downloaded both files 
32PO20130829.exc.csv
317W20130803.exc.csv
Once you are at this website all you need to do to recieve the data is to click on the hyper link for each and it should automatically download for use.  Ensure that the files are in the same folder that your Python Project code is to ensure it will gather the data properly for use.
I then used Python to write code that will procees both files and present the data in a graph.  
You can accces the same python code from my repository on this subject. 
The graphs will show the results of the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water to the depth that it is at.
